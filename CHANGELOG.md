# Changelog

All notable changes to Ultimatum are listed here. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); the version in `plugins/ultimatum/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is the source of truth and must be bumped for installs to update.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-11 (preview)

First public preview. Tested on small fixture projects only; see `docs/TEST-REPORT.md` for exactly what was and was not tested.

### Added
- One entry command, `/ultimatum:work <task>`, routing to workflows for small changes, discovery, features, large features with parallel workers, debugging, CI/PR feedback, UI with browser verification, data and infrastructure, bounded optimization, releases, handoff and resume.
- Three security workflows: a secure-implementation pass that runs automatically on sensitive changes, security review of a change, and full audit with a coverage ledger, a fresh verifier, and confirmed / needs-validation / rejected findings.
- Five subagents: `scout`, `worker`, `reviewer`, `security-hunter`, `security-verifier`.
- `ult` toolbelt (Python 3.9+ standard library, no network): `run`/`log` with raw-log recovery, `search`/`symbols`/`refs`, `map`, `note`/`find`/`get`, `handoff`, `scan` (wraps Semgrep, Gitleaks and OSV-Scanner when installed), `findings`, `doctor`.
- `ult-browser.mjs`: Playwright-based viewport, interaction, and accessibility checks, with axe-core when installed.
- `ULTIMATUM_STATE_DIR` to keep all state outside the repository for strict read-only work.
- CI: unit tests on Python 3.9, 3.11 and 3.13, plus `claude plugin validate --strict`.

### Fixed before release
- `ult search` crashed with a traceback on an invalid regex and on a `--path` outside the project when ripgrep was not installed. Found by the first CI run (CI runners have no ripgrep); both now exit with a clear error, on both the ripgrep and pure-Python paths.

### Known limitations
- Not yet tested on large real-world repositories or with models other than `sonnet`.
- Costs about 1.5–1.8x plain Claude Code per task in the recorded evals; no token-savings claim is made.
- CI/PR, production, data/infra, optimization and release workflows were tested for routing only.
